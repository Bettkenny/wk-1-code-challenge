Generating student grades
Function prompts the user to input students mark between 0 to 100. The getStudentGrade() function prompts the user to input a student's mark and then checks whether the input is valid. If the input is not between 0 and 100, the function returns an error message. Otherwise, it checks the mark against each grade boundary and returns the corresponding grades.

Speed Detector
Speed function takes the speed of the car as an argument and compare it to the speed limit which is 70. If the speed is less than or equal to the speed limit it prints OK.If the speed is greater than the speed limit it calculates the number of demerits points based on how many km/s over the limit the driver was going. If it is more than 12 demerit points it prints  "License Suspended". I also prints the number of demerits the driver have accumulated.
